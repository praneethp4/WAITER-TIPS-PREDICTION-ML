# WAITER-TIPS-PREDICTION-ML
#### In this project we will predict tips given to a waiter for his/her service.
#### Task (T): Analyzing and predicting the tips for a waiter. 
#### Experience (E): A collection of various data sets that include some attribute related to the waiter, services, total bill, smoker, time etc. 
#### Performance (P): The number of successful predictions made out of the total number of requests received from the client. 

# DATASET
#### The dataset contains attributes total_bill, tip, sex, smoker, day,time, size,price_per_person,payer name, cc number

# DATA PREPROCESSING
Aim is to predict the tip from other columns therefore we have to scale the numerical columns and encode categorical columns. For binary ones we have to either use label encoding or one hot encode them, then drop duplicate ones.

# LEARNING ALGORITHMS
#### Linear Regression
#### Support Vector Machine
#### KNN
#### Random Forest Regressor

# RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
#### Random Forest Regressor model gave us the more accuracy
